# Algorithms and Coding

- dynamic programming
- recursion
- graph



# System Design

- architecture
- object oriented design
- database shema design
- distributed system
- scalability



e.g.

- Hbase
  - run DDL with Client
  - Get operation
  - the role of Zookeeper
  - the process of read/write
  - how to maintain strong consistency
  - what will minor/major compaction do
  - LRU Cache and Bloom Filter
- Hbase & Cassandra
  - the difference in design
  - how to make a balance between consistance and availability
  - the comparison between master-slave and master-master
